1. API Development (books.py): Created a FastAPI server to expose an endpoint for fetching book data.
Defined a function booksfn() to generate sample book data.
Implemented a route /health-check to check the server's status and verify that the server is running correctly.
Implemented a GET endpoint /books-api to retrieve book data by calling the booksfn() function to get book data and returning the book data in JSON format if available, otherwise return an error message.

2. Data Retrieval and Storage (API Data Retrieval and Storage.ipynb): Fetched book data from the API created in books.py, stored it in a SQLite database 'books' and displayed the retrieved data.
Sent a GET request to the API endpoint /books-api to fetch book data and extracted the JSON data from the response if the status code is 200 else print an error message.
Connected to the SQLite database (books.db) and created a table named books.
Iterated over the book data and insert each book into the books table.
Read the contents of the books table and printed them.
